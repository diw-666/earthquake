# ðŸ“„ Column Descriptions â€“ Earthquakes_South_Asia.csv

This file provides brief explanations for each column in the earthquake dataset.

| Column            | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `time`            | Timestamp of the earthquake in UTC. |
| `latitude`        | Epicenter latitude in decimal degrees. |
| `longitude`       | Epicenter longitude in decimal degrees. |
| `depth`           | Depth of the earthquake (in kilometers). |
| `mag`             | Magnitude of the earthquake. |
| `magType`         | Method used to calculate the magnitude (e.g., mb, ml, mw). |
| `nst`             | Number of seismic stations used to determine the location. |
| `gap`             | Azimuthal gap (in degrees) between the closest seismic stations. |
| `dmin`            | Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (degrees). |
| `rms`             | Root mean square value of seismic wave amplitudes. |
| `net`             | Network that provided the data. |
| `id`              | Unique event ID. |
| `updated`         | Timestamp of the last update to the event record. |
| `place`           | Human-readable location of the earthquake. |
| `type`            | Type of seismic event (e.g., earthquake, explosion, quarry blast). |
| `horizontalError` | Estimated horizontal error (in kilometers). |
| `depthError`      | Estimated error in the depth measurement (in kilometers). |
| `magError`        | Estimated error in the magnitude value. |
| `magNst`          | Number of stations contributing to the magnitude calculation. |
| `status`          | Review status of the event (e.g., reviewed, automatic). |
| `locationSource`  | Agency that provided the earthquake location. |
| `magSource`       | Agency that provided the earthquake magnitude. |
